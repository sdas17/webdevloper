# for data in range (5):
#     print(data)
# number =5
# while number>0:
#     number-=1
#     print(number)

# Notes: Difference between for loop and while loop (real-time examples)
# - for loop: iterates over a known set of items or a fixed number of times.
# - while loop: repeats as long as a condition is true (good for monitoring or waiting for events).
#
# Example 1 — for loop (processing a fixed set of messages with a short delay)
# Example 2 — while loop (real-time input monitoring; type 'stop' to finish)
